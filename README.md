# datacamp-best-crops-prediction

This is a repository to tackle [the challenge in DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/1772).
In this project, you will build multi-class classification models to predict the type of "crop" and identify the single most importance feature for predictive performance.
